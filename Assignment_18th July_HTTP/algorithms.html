    <h1>Algorithms and Data Structures</h1>
    <p>Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to computer science and programming. They form the backbone of efficient problem-solving and data management in computing.</p>
    
    <h2>Algorithm Design</h2>
    <p>Algorithm design involves the study of techniques for designing efficient algorithms that solve computational problems. This includes understanding algorithm complexity, optimization strategies, and algorithm analysis.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Structures</h2>
    <p>Data structures refer to the way data is organized and stored in a computer's memory or disk. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Each structure has its own strengths and weaknesses for different types of operations.</p>
