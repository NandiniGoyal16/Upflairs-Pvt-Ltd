    <h1>Computer Architecture</h1>
    <p>Computer architecture refers to the design and organization of computer systems, including hardware and software components. It involves understanding how computers work and optimizing their performance.</p>
    
    <h2>Processor Design</h2>
    <p>Processor design focuses on designing the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. It includes the architecture, instruction set, pipeline design, and performance optimization of processors.</p>
    
    <h2>Memory Systems</h2>
    <p>Memory systems in computers involve the organization and management of different types of memory, including RAM (Random Access Memory) and caches. Memory hierarchy design and optimization are crucial for improving computer performance.</p>
    
    <h2>Parallel Computing</h2>
    <p>Parallel computing involves executing multiple tasks simultaneously to achieve faster computation. It includes parallel architectures, parallel programming models, and algorithms designed for parallel execution on multi-core processors or distributed systems.</p>
