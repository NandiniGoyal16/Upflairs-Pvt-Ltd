    <h1>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h1>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence. AI encompasses various subfields and applications.</p>
    
    <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
    <p>Machine learning is a subset of AI that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that allow computers to learn from and make decisions based on data. It includes supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</p>
    
    <h2>Natural Language Processing</h2>
    <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) deals with the interaction between computers and humans using natural language. It involves tasks such as text analysis, language translation, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition.</p>
    
    <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
    <p>Computer Vision involves enabling computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world. Applications include image and video recognition, object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
    
    <h2>Robotics</h2>
    <p>Robotics combines AI with engineering to create machines capable of performing tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Robotics applications range from industrial automation to healthcare, space exploration, and consumer electronics.</p>
